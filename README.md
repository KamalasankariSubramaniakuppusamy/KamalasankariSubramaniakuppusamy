Hi 👋 I’m Kamala  
<br/>
<sub>My name is long enough to need its own TL;DR — Kamala (most people skim my name before they skim my profile)</sub>
</h2>

<p align="center">
<b>TL;DR</b> — I entered Computer Science late, built my credit from scratch through real systems, research, and teaching, and now work at the intersection of software engineering, AI/ML, and learning how to reason with machines.

<h3>Who I Am</h3>

<p>
I officially entered the field of Computer Science <b>three years ago</b>.
</p>

<p>
Before that, I was on a completely different path — <b>Electronics Engineering</b>, learning about circuits, semiconductors, and hardware-first problem solving.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No early exposure to web development</li>
  <li>No ML projects in undergrad</li>
  <li>No years of GitHub streaks</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I <i>did</i> have was curiosity — and one opportunity that changed everything.
</p>

<h3>The Turning Point</h3>

<p>
In <b>2023</b>, I was assigned a project to build a <b>deep learning model for roof material detection</b> using aerial imagery.
</p>

<p>
The goal wasn’t academic — it was practical: <b>better urban planning in flood-prone regions</b> so communities don’t suffer the same damage every monsoon.
</p>

<p>
At the time, I only had <b>basic programming knowledge</b>.
</p>

<p>
So I learned what I needed — fast, properly, and from first principles.
</p>

<p>
I built an <b>object detection system</b>, optimized it for real-world data, and turned the work into a <b>research paper</b>.
That paper was <b>published at IEEE</b> and won a <b>Best Paper Award</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>I chose Computer Science — deliberately.</b>
</p>

<h3>Internship: LILLUP — Where I Learned to Build for Real</h3>

<p>
At LILLUP, I stopped thinking like a student and started thinking like a systems engineer.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Modular file-to-JSON parser architecture</li>
  <li>Offline + cloud-powered FastAPI backend</li>
  <li>OCR integration</li>
  <li>CLI & GUI interfaces</li>
  <li>Dockerized deployments</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is where I learned how real software behaves — messy inputs, scale, trade-offs.
