Hi 👋 I’m Kamala  
<br/>
<sub>My name is long enough to need its own TL;DR — Kamala (most people skim my name before they skim my profile)</sub>
</h2>

<p align="center">
<b>TL;DR</b> — I entered Computer Science late, built my credit from scratch through real systems, research, and teaching, and now work at the intersection of software engineering, AI/ML, and learning how to reason with machines.

<h3>Who I Am</h3>

<p>
I officially entered the field of Computer Science <b>three years ago</b>.
</p>

<p>
Before that, I was on a completely different path — <b>Electronics Engineering</b>, learning about circuits, semiconductors, and hardware-first problem solving.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No early exposure to web development</li>
  <li>No ML projects in undergrad</li>
  <li>No years of GitHub streaks</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I <i>did</i> have was curiosity — and one opportunity that changed everything.
</p>

###

<h3>The Turning Point</h3>

<p>
In <b>2023</b>, I was assigned a project to build a <b>deep learning model for roof material detection</b> using aerial imagery.
</p>

<p>
The goal wasn’t academic — it was practical: <b>better urban planning in flood-prone regions</b> so communities don’t suffer the same damage every monsoon.
</p>

<p>
At the time, I only had <b>basic programming knowledge</b>.
</p>

<p>
So I learned what I needed — fast, properly, and from first principles.
</p>

<p>
I built an <b>object detection system</b>, optimized it for real-world data, and turned the work into a <b>research paper</b>.
That paper was <b>published at IEEE</b> and won a <b>Best Paper Award</b>.
</p>

<p>
That moment made my direction clear.
<br/>
<b>I chose Computer Science — deliberately.</b>
</p>

<h3>What I Do Now</h3>

<ul>
  <li>🎓 <b>Master’s in Computer Science</b> (Machine Intelligence & Cognition)</li>
  <li>🤖 <b>AI/ML Researcher</b> working on:
    <ul>
      <li>Software vulnerability detection & remediation</li>
      <li>Language-agnostic code analysis</li>
      <li>LLM-based reasoning systems</li>
      <li>CVSS-style risk scoring, explainability, and automation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🧠 Exploring <b>Reinforcement Learning</b>:
    <ul>
      <li>State abstraction</li>
      <li>History vs trajectory</li>
      <li>Decision-making under uncertainty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>🧑‍💻 <b>Software Engineer</b> who builds end-to-end systems, not just models</li>
</ul>

<h3>Internship: LILLUP — Where I Learned to Build for Real</h3>

<p>
My internship at <b>LILLUP</b> is where I stopped thinking like a student and started thinking like a systems engineer.
</p>

<p>
I worked on designing and building a <b>production-grade file-to-JSON parser system</b>, not a one-off script.
</p>

<b>What I Built</b>
<ul>
  <li>Modular parser architecture supporting multiple file formats</li>
  <li>Offline and cloud-powered versions of the same system</li>
  <li>FastAPI backend for uploads and structured JSON responses</li>
  <li>OCR integration for scanned documents</li>
  <li>Robust error handling, logging, and validation</li>
  <li>Clean CLI and GUI interfaces</li>
  <li>Dockerized deployments for portability</li>
</ul>

<p>
This experience taught me how real software behaves — messy inputs, scale issues, design trade-offs — and how to engineer systems that survive them.
</p>

###

<h3>Learning Late, Learning Deep</h3>

<p>
Coming into CS late meant one thing was unavoidable:
<br/>
<b>Everyone around me already had years of experience.</b>
</p>

<p>
So instead of trying to look “advanced”, I focused on <b>building credit</b>:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learning fundamentals properly</li>
  <li>Building projects end-to-end</li>
  <li>Documenting my learning honestly</li>
  <li>Writing things from scratch before using abstractions</li>
</ul>

<p>
That approach now defines how I work.
</p>

###

<h3>Teaching & Academic Work</h3>

<p>
I’ve worked as a <b>Student Academic Assistant</b> for <b>Advanced Machine Learning</b>, where I:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assisted professors with coursework and grading</li>
  <li>Guided students through difficult ML concepts</li>
  <li>Helped debug assignments and clarify theory ↔ implementation gaps</li>
</ul>

<p>
Teaching advanced ML forced me to understand concepts <b>well enough to explain them clearly</b>, not just use them.
</p>

###

<h3>Writing & Handbooks</h3>

<p>
I write <b>Medium articles</b> and am currently designing <b>beginner-to-advanced theoretical-practical handbooks</b> that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build intuition first</li>
  <li>Explain the math clearly</li>
  <li>Show how concepts look when coded from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>
They’re written for people who, like me, don’t learn well from surface-level explanations.
</p>

<p>
If I struggled to understand something — I turn it into a resource.
</p>

###

<h3>How I Think About CS</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t start early — I started <b>intentionally</b></li>
  <li>I value <b>clarity over cleverness</b></li>
  <li>I care about <b>systems that work</b>, not demos that impress</li>
  <li>I believe strong engineers are built by understanding <i>why</i>, not memorizing <i>how</i></li>
</ul>

###

<h3>Currently Exploring</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
  <li>Agentic AI systems</li>
  <li>Explainable and safer ML</li>
  <li>Scaling research ideas into usable software</li>
</ul>
